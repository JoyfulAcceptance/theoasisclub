## What GitHub *is*

GitHub is just:

- A folder  
- With version history  
- That lives on the internet  
- And remembers every change forever  

That’s it. Everything else is optional noise.

## Common Words (Translated Into English)

| GitHub Word | Human Meaning |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Repository (Repo)** | A folder. |
| **File** | A file. Same as on your computer. |
| **Commit** | Save this change and remember it. |
| **Branch** | A “safe version” of the folder you can edit without messing things up. |
| **Pull Request (PR)** | “Hey, can we merge this change into the main folder?” |
| **Clone** | Download the whole folder to your computer. |
| **Push** | Upload your changes to GitHub. |
| **Issues** | A to-do list. |
| **README** | The intro page that explains what this folder is. |

If you understand these, you understand GitHub. Everything else is opera.

## How to Upload a File

1. Go to your repo (your project folder on GitHub).  
2. Click **Add file → Upload files.**  
3. Drag in your file.  
4. Click **Commit changes** (means “SAVE IT”).  
5. You’re done.

---

## How to Create a New File

1. Go to your repo.  
2. Click **Add file → Create new file.**  
3. Type the filename.  
4. Paste or write your content.  
5. Click **Commit changes**.

---

## How to Make a Folder

GitHub won’t give you a “New Folder” button. So:

1. Click **Add file → Create new file.**  
2. In “Name your file,” type:  
   `foldername/filename.md`  
3. Commit.

GitHub creates the folder automatically.

---

## How to Rename or Move a File

1. Click the file.  
2. Click the little pencil icon (✏️ Edit file).  
3. Change the name at the top:  
   `myfile.md` → `docs/myfile.md`  
4. Commit.

That’s “moving” a file.

---

## How to See Old Versions

1. Open the file.  
2. Click **History.**  
3. Click any version to see what it looked like.

GitHub remembers everything.

---

## How to UNDO a Mistake

Think: **“Undo” instead of “Revert a commit.”**

Options:

- Make a new change that fixes the problem and **Commit** again, or  
- Open **History**, copy an older version, paste it back in, and **Commit**, or  
- Use Git’s “revert” tools later if you ever want the nerd version of Undo.

Point: **You can always undo. Nothing is final.**

---

## GitHub Laws (Human Edition)

1. If you can upload a file, you can use GitHub.  
2. If engineers use weird words, translate them.  
3. **Commit = SAVE.**  
4. The **README** is your welcome mat.  
5. You cannot truly break GitHub; it keeps the history.

## Suggested Structure for “GitHub for Humans”

This can grow into a small library of human-language guides:

- `github-for-humans/` — this folder  
- `github-for-humans/guides/` — longer how-tos  
- `github-for-humans/cheatsheets/` — one-pagers  
- `github-for-humans/archive/` — old versions

This page is the starting point.
