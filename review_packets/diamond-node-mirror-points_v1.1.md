## 1. System Unification
MIT/NICE stresses that AI impact depends on eliminating data silos and stitching systems together.  
**Diamond Node** does this at a deeper level: unifying *research, provenance, creative artifacts,* and *institutional workflows* into one coherent backbone.

## 2. Trust as Infrastructure
The report identifies trust as the limiting reagent for AI deployment.  
**Diamond Node** builds trust through explicit provenance, audit trails, DTL markers, and transparent style-sheet governance.

## 3. Human Expertise at the Center
MIT/NICE emphasizes the “human edge” — AI augments expertise, doesn’t replace it.  
**Diamond Node** operationalizes this with layered style-sheets (Robin, Linda, Bruce, etc.) so human judgment is structurally encoded, not erased.

## 4. From Pilots to Production
Organizations get stuck at prototypes. MIT/NICE notes that real value comes only once systems are integrated end-to-end.  
**Diamond Node** already embodies this by designing for *publishability, versioning, licensing,* and *institutional collaboration* from day one.

## 5. Interoperability Over Tools
The report highlights that tooling is secondary; what matters is how pieces connect.  
**Diamond Node** is explicitly *connection-first*: Oasis ↔ Diamond Node ↔ Daisy, each layer modular, but unified through provenance logic.

## 6. Ethics as a Performance Variable
MIT/NICE touches lightly on governance but avoids depth.  
**Diamond Node** treats ethics as an operational asset — the Dignity Net, Ambiguity Clause, and Calm-in-Storm Protocol — not merely compliance.

## 7. Scalability Through Clarity
The report links scalable AI to clear conceptual models.  
**Diamond Node** provides a simple stack (Marketplace → Research Spine → AI Governance) that scales without losing identity or narrative coherence.
